--------------------------------

Note that this project is developed to demonstrate how spring integration of blazeds is made:
	- This example project is demonstrated for spring-blazeds-classroom-flex project 
	  to communicate with backend through blazeds. After you build the project 
	  with maven and then execute test code, sample data is imported to HSQL database,
	  runs the test code and finally drops created tables.

How to build project:
	- mvn clean package
	- Copy target/spring-blazeds-classroom-1.0.0.war to your tomcat webapps directory.
	- Execute catalina run under bin directory of tomcat to start the server.
	- If you shutdown the server (by pressing Ctrl+C), all created tables are dropped from HSQL db.

How to test project:
	- mvn clean test
